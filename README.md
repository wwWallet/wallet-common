# Wallet Common


This library serves as a centralized collection of reusable component-functions that are shared across multiple software stacks. Its main goal is to promote consistency, reduce duplication, and streamline development by providing well-tested, commonly used utilities and components in one place.

### Key components

- Credential Parsing
- Credential Rendering
- Credential Verification
- Common type definitions
- Common JSON schema definition for response validations


### Intefaces

The `interface.ts` file defines all the interfaces that are exported from this library.
